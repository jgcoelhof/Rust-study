//Partial move
// Within the destructuring of a single variable,

// which means that parts of the variable will be moved while other parts stay.
// In such a case,
// the parent variable cannot be used afterwards as a whole,
// however the parts that are only referenced (and not moved) can still be used.
//
// Example
